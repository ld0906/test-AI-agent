content='Here\'s a breakdown of the test points for the requirement:\n\n**Requirement:** "用户可以上传不超过5MB的图片作为头像" (User can upload a picture not exceeding 5MB as a profile picture)\n\n**Test Points:**\n\n1. **File type validation**:\n\t* Test that only image files (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) are accepted.\n\t* Test that non-image files (e.g., .txt, .doc, .exe) are rejected.\n2. **File size validation**:\n\t* Test that files up to 5MB in size are accepted.\n\t* Test that files larger than 5MB are rejected.\n\t* Test that files exactly 5MB in size are accepted (edge case).\n3. **Upload functionality**:\n\t* Test that the upload process completes successfully when a valid image file is uploaded.\n\t* Test that the uploaded image is displayed as the user\'s profile picture.\n4. **Error handling**:\n\t* Test that an error message is displayed when a non-image file is attempted.\n\t* Test that an error message is displayed when a file larger than 5MB is attempted.\n\t* Test that the error message is clear and informative (e.g., "File type not supported" or "File too large, max 5MB").\n6. **Boundary testing**:\n\t* Test that the upload process is user-friendly and doesn\'t cause any issues with the user\'s profile information.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n* Test that the system can handle multiple file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n* Test that the system can handle different image resolutions and aspect ratios.\n* Test that the system can handle files with non-ASCII characters in the file name.\n\nBy covering these test points, you can ensure that the requirement is met and the system behaves as expected.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 385, 'prompt_tokens': 36, 'total_tokens': 421, 'completion_time': 1.220137215, 'prompt_time': 0.000729352, 'queue_time': 0.217598554, 'total_time': 1.220866567}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_dd4ae1c591', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--cac17e26-5dc7-4058-887a-c170bd4be1eb-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 36, 'output_tokens': 385, 'total_tokens': 421}
